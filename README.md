# Weather-Prediction
A machine learning project for weather forecasting using historical data
# 🌦 Weather Forecasting ML Project

This project uses historical weather data to build a machine learning model that predicts key weather metrics like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. It also includes automated data updates and visualizations using a Supaboard dashboard.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains hourly weather data for 5 Indian cities during March 2025. Features include:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Cloud cover
- UV index
- Precipitation
- And more!

## 📊 Dashboard

Predictions and trends are visualized in Supaboard (or any BI tool of choice).

## 🤖 ML Model

We’ll use supervised learning (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTM) to forecast weather conditions based on historical patterns.

## 📂 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/weather-forecast-ml.git
